 * Device_Handle_t
 *
 * This handle represents a device, typically one hardware block instance.
 *
 * The Device API can access the static device resources (registers and RAM
 * inside the device) using offsets inside the device. This abstracts memory
 * map knowledge and simplifies device instantiation.
 *
 * Each device has its own configuration, including the endianess swapping
 * need for the words transferred. Endianess swapping can thus be performed
 * on the fly and transparent to the caller.
 *
 * The details of the handle are implementation specific and must not be
 * relied on, with one exception: NULL is guaranteed to be a non-existing
 * handle.
