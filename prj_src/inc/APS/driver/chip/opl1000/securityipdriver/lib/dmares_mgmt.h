/*****************************************************************************
 * DMA Resource API
 *
 * This API is related to management of memory buffers that can be accessed by
 * the host as well as a device, using Direct Memory Access (DMA). A driver
 * must typically support many of these shared resources. This API helps with
 * administration of these resources.
 *
 * This API maintains administration records that the caller can read and
 * write directly. A handle is also provided to abstract the record.
 * The handle cannot be used to directly access the resource and is therefore
 * considered safe to pass around in the system, even to applications.
 *
 * Another important aspect of this API is to provide a point where resources
 * can be handed over between the host and the device. The driver library or
 * adapter must call the PreDMA and PostDMA functions to indicate the hand over
 * of access right between the host and the device for an entire resource, or
 * part thereof. The implementation can use these calls to manage the
 * data coherence for the resource, for example in a cached system.
 *
 * Dynamic DMA resources such as DMA-safe buffers covered by this API
 * are different from static Device resources (see the Device API)
 * which represent device-internal resources with possible read and write
 * side-effects.
 *
 * On the fly endianess conversion (byte swap) for integers is supported for
 * DMA resources by means of the Read32 and Write32 functions.
 *
 * Note: If multiple devices with a different memory view need to use the same
 * DMA resource, then the caller should consider separate records for each
 * device (for the same buffer).
