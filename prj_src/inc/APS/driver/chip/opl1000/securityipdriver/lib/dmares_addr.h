 * DMAResource_Translate
 *
 * Attempts to provide an address for a DMA Resource that can be used in the

 * used by a device to perform DMA.

 * Handle (input)
 *     The handle to the DMA Resource record that was returned by
 *     DMAResource_Alloc, DMAResource_CheckAndRegister or DMAResource_Attach.
 *
 * DestDomain (input)
 *     The requested domain to translate the address to.
 *     Please check the implementation notes for supported domains.
 *
 * PairOut_p (output)
 *     Pointer to the memory location when the converted address plus domain
 *     will be written.

 * Return Values
 *     0    Success

 * DMAResource_AddPair
 *
 * This function can be used to register another address pair known to the
 * caller for a DMA Resource.
 * The information will be stored in the DMA Resource Record and can be used
 * by DMAResource_Translate.
 * Typically used when an external DMA-safe buffer allocator returns two
 * addresses (for example virtual and physical).
 * Note: How many address pairs are supported is implementation specific.
 *
 * Handle (input)
 *     The handle to the DMA Resource record that was returned by
 *     DMAResource_CheckAndRegister or DMAResource_Attach.
 *
 * Pair (input)
 *     Address pair (address + domain) to be associated with the DMA Resource.
 *
 * Return Values
 *     0    Success
 *     <0   Error code (implementation dependent)
